          <p class="mb-2">
            I developed a suite of Power BI dashboards that surfaced product and business metrics for teams at Pleaz.
            The work involved aligning with stakeholders on questions, shaping metrics, and iterating on visualizations
            that were simple enough to use daily while still capturing the right level of detail.

            <li><strong>My role:</strong> requirements gathering, data modeling, dashboard design, roll-out & support</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> clearer view of adoption and usage patterns, faster identification of at-risk accounts, and better prioritization for content</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Overview Dashboard (Management & Customer Success)</h3>
        <p>
          Tracked weekly activations and usage by customer. Helped management monitor adoption trends, 
          supported the customer success team in focusing their outreach, and gave the content team 
          insights into which types of videos were most watched.

          Visualized when users were active during the day, giving insights into how and when routines were forming.
          This became a daily tool for the customer success team, who used it to guide clients toward 
          establishing sustainable usage patterns.
